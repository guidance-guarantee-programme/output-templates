Feature: Summary document contents
  As Pension Wise
  We want to provide a summary document that is as tailored as possible
  So that customers are reminded of what was discussed, including next steps that they may wish to take

Scenario: No supplementary information
  Given a customer doesnâ€™t require any supplementary information
  When we generate a summary document
  Then the sections it includes should be (in order):
    | getting started          |
    | options overview         |
    | detail about each option |
    | inheritance tax          |
    | scams                    |
    | pension tax rules        |
    | feedback                 |
    | further guidance         |

Scenario Outline: Supplementary information can be included
  Given the customer requires supplementary information about "<topic>"
  When we generate a summary document
  Then it should include supplementary information about "<topic>"

  Examples:
