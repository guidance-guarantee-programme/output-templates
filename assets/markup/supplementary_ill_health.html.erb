<h2>Pensions and ill health</h2>

<% if appointment_50_54? %>
  <p>You may be able to take your pension pot early if you’re under 55 and you have ill health. Each pension scheme has a different definition of ill health and different rules for taking your pension early – speak to your provider. </p>
<% end %>

<p>Special tax rules apply if you have a serious illness which means you’re expected to live for less than a year.</p>

<p>You may be able to take your whole pension pot tax free if all of the following apply to you:</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>You’re expected to live for less than a year because of serious illness.</li>
  <% if appointment_50_54? %>
    <li>You don’t have more than the lifetime allowance of £1.25 million (£1 million after April 2016) in pension money.</li>
  <% else %>
    <li>You’re under 75 (if you’re over 75 you pay Income Tax on the lump sum).</li>
    <li>You don’t have more than the lifetime allowance of £1 million in pension money.</li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

<p>Check the terms of your pension with your provider. Some pensions will keep at least 50% of your pot for your spouse or partner.</p>
