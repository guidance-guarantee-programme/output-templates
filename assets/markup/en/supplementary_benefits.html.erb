<h2>Benefits and pension income</h2>

<p>Any money you take from your pension pot will be counted towards the income or savings that are assessed when checking your eligibility for some state benefits. This may affect your entitlement to some benefits or mean you get less money.</p>
<p>If you or anyone in your household are receiving or have received any means-tested state benefits in the last 12 months, or you plan to apply for them, you should contact the relevant paying authority to check how accessing your pension can affect your entitlement.</p>

<h3>When your pension affects your benefits</h3>
<p>The way money from your pension is assessed depends on whether you or your partner have reached the qualifying age for Pension Credit – which is the same as your State Pension Age – use the State Pension Age calculator on <a target="_blank" rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-age">gov.uk/state-pension-age</a> to check when this is.</p>
<p>Taking money from your pot, whether it is tax-free cash, lumps sums, or income, may affect your entitlement to benefits, or the entitlement of your partner or other members of your household.</p>
<p>If you or anyone in your household is claiming benefits, it is the responsibility of the benefits claimant to tell the benefit paying authority (the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or your local council) if you or your partner take any money from your pension pot.</p>
<p>If you deliberately spend or give away money (including tax-free cash) from your pot to avoid a reduction in, or start to get, or to increase benefits and help with care costs, DWP, HMRC or your local council may assess your finances again and treat you as still having that money.</p>
<p>Your other assets (eg savings and investments) may also be added to income or cash taken from your pot when you’re assessed for benefits.</p>
