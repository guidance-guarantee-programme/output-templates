<h2>Tax when your pension pot is inherited</h2>

<h3 class="icon icon--goal">The following tax rules apply to leaving your pot untouched, taking cash in chunks, and getting an adjustable income.</h3>

<h4>You die before 75</h4>
<p>No tax if whoever your money is left to when you die (your ‘beneficiary’) claims the money within 2 years. They can take a lump sum or get an income from it.</p>

<h4>You die at 75 or after</h4>
<p>Before April 2016 your beneficiary pays 45% tax on lump sums and Income Tax if they take an income from the investments.</p>

<p>After April 2016 they pay Income Tax on lump sums and income. Additional tax is payable for amounts over £1.25 million.</p>

<h3 class="icon icon--goal">The following tax rules apply to certain types of annuity which you can pass on when you die.</h3>

<h4>You die before 75</h4>
<p>Any income or lump sum payments are tax free.</p>

<h4>You die at 75 or after</h4>
<p>If you have a joint or fixed-term annuity – one that stops paying at the end of a set period of time – your spouse or partner pays tax on the income.</p>

<p>If you have a capital or value protected annuity – one where your beneficiary inherits a lump sum from your pot minus any annuity payments you received before you died – your beneficiary pays 45% tax before April 2016 and then tax on the income.</p>

<h3 class="icon icon--goal">The following tax rules apply to taking your whole pot in one go</h3>
<p>No matter when you die the money you pass on is part of your estate (money, property and possessions).</p>

<p>You pay Inheritance Tax if your estate is worth more than £325,000 when you die. This is called the ‘Inheritance Tax threshold’ and can be worth up to £650,000 for married couples or civil partners.</p>
