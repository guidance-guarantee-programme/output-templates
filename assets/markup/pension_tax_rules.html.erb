<h3>Lifetime Allowance</h3>

<p>The Lifetime Allowance (LTA) is a limit on the total amount of pension benefits you can save over your lifetime, without incurring tax penalties when benefits are paid out or on reaching age 75.</p>
<p>Most people are not affected by this as it only applies where the value of all your pension pots is over £1,073,100, which is the limit for the tax year ending 5 April 2023.</p>
<p>When certain payments are made from a pension scheme, a check is completed, to see if you have any remaining lifetime allowance. If there isn’t enough allowance left, then a tax charge is payable. The way the charge applies depends on whether the excess is paid as a lump sum or as regular income.</p>
<p>You could consider taking specialist tax advice from a regulated financial adviser if you want additional information or advice, or you can get further information on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/">moneyhelper.org.uk</a> (search for ‘Lifetime allowance’)</p>

<h3>Money Purchase Annual Allowance (MPAA)</h3>

<p>Some of the pension payment options will limit your ability to receive tax relief on any future contributions you (or your employer) pay. Before you make a final decision on withdrawing money you should consider that taking your pension as a number of lump sums, cashing in pots worth more than £10,000, taking money from a pension drawdown plan and setting up a fixed term annuity reduce the total amount of tax relief you’ll receive on pension contributions to a Defined Contribution pension from £40,000 per annum to £4,000 per annum. Buying a lifetime annuity does not trigger the MPAA. Nor does only taking tax-free cash when setting up a pension drawdown plan. It is only when you draw taxable money from the pension drawdown plan that the MPAA is triggered.</p>

<h3>Pension Recycling</h3>

<p>If you’re planning to take your tax-free lump sum when buying a guaranteed or flexible retirement income and pay into the same pension pot or another one, you need to be aware of ‘pension recycling’ laws. These rules do not apply to taking your pension as a number of lump sums or taking your whole pension in one go.</p>
<p>It could be pension recycling if you intend to use the tax-free lump sum to pay into a pension to get tax relief.</p>
<p>The rules can result in you paying 55% tax on the whole tax-free lump sum. Pension recycling will not normally be applicable where the total tax-free cash taken from all your pots in a 12 month period is under £7,500. If you are taking tax-free cash over this amount you could consider taking financial advice if you’re thinking of increasing your pension contributions within 2 tax years before or after taking the lump sum.</p>
