<h2>Debt and pensions</h2>
<p>You should think carefully about taking money from your pension pot to pay off debts. Money you take from your pot now could leave you with less to live on in the future.</p>

<p>If you have any debt relief orders, creditors may be able to access some or all of the pension income or lump sums you take.</p>

<p>This includes money or income from:</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>An annuity</li>
  <li>A flexi-access drawdown fund</li>
  <li>Any cash taken in chunks</li>
  <li>Any cash from taking your whole pot in one go</li>
</ul>

<p class="emphasise">Find out the status of your debt relief orders before choosing a pension option. You can contact the Insolvency Service on 0300 678 0015 for help with this.</p>

<h3>Getting help with debt</h3>
<p>Take your time when deciding what to do with your pot and don’t rush into a decision. </p>
