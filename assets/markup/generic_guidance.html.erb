<h3>Key facts</h3>

<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>While the money stays in your pot you don’t pay tax on it.</li>
  <li>It’s up to you when you take the money out – the earliest is usually aged 55, unless you have a serious illness.</li>
  <li>If someone contacts you unexpectedly about getting money out of your pot before you’re 55, it’s nearly always a pension scam.</li>
  <% if appointment_50_54? %>
    <!-- section: warning about leaving pot beyond selected retirement age -->
    <li>You may still be able to pay into your pot but you could be charged for leaving your pot beyond your ‘selected retirement age’ – the age you agreed to retire with your provider.</li>
  <% else %>
    <li>You can also still pay into your pot but there may be restrictions. If you’re an employee your employer might continue to make contributions too.</li>
  <% end %>
  <li>Money left in your pot can be passed on when you die.</li>

<h3>Key facts</h3>

<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>This is a type of insurance product which gives you a guaranteed income.</li>

  <li>You can take up to 25% of your pot tax free – if you do this you must buy an annuity with the remaining 75% or use one of the other options.</li>

<h2 class="option">3. Get a flexible retirement income (pension drawdown)</h2>

<h3>Key facts</h3>

<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>You get an income from your pot which is taxable. You decide how much to take out and when, and how long you want it to last. This option is known as ‘pension drawdown’.</li>
  <li>You move your pot to a pension drawdown product, then you can take up to 25% of your pot tax free and the remaining funds are invested. You can decide how much and how often you want to draw money from the pot.</li>
  <li>Your provider will ask you how you want to invest your remaining pot when you move into pension drawdown. You will either need to choose your own investments, i.e. ones that match your attitude to risk and objectives for your money, or some providers will offer you to choose from simple ready-made investment options which are linked to your retirement plans (these are called Investment Pathways). You could also use a financial adviser to help you choose.</li>
  <li>An investment pathway is a ready-made investment option, which simplifies the decision of how to invest your remaining pension pot after you’ve taken your tax-free lump sum.</li>
  <li>As with all investments, the value of your pot can go up or down.</li>
  <li>You may be able to keep paying into another pension after you take money out, but you could pay tax on contributions over £4,000 a year (known as the ‘money purchase annual allowance’).</li>

<h2 class="option">4. Take your pension as a number of lump sums</h2>

<h3>Key facts</h3>

<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>Instead of taking your whole pension in one go, you take smaller lump sums over time. 25% of each lump sum you take out is tax free and the rest is taxable.</li>
  <li>75% of the lump sum of cash you take will get taxed along with any other income you have, eg from work, savings or investments.</li>
  <li>You’re likely to be involved in choosing and managing your investments.</li>
  <li>You can spread the lump sums out over multiple tax years to reduce your income which could mean you pay less tax.</li>
  <li>Providers may describe this option as ‘Uncrystallised Funds Pension Lump Sum’ (UFPLS).</li>
  <li>You may be able to keep paying in after you take money out but you could pay tax on contributions over £4,000 a year (known as the ‘money purchase annual allowance’).</li>

<h2 class="option">5. Take your whole pension in one go</h2>

<h3>Key facts</h3>

<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>If you take your whole pension in one go 25% is tax free and the remaining 75% is taxable.</li>
  <li>The money from your pot will be added to any other income you have over the tax year.</li>
  <li>Adding a large cash sum to your income could put you in a higher tax band.</li>
  <li>You can take up to 3 small pots of up to £10,000 without it counting towards your annual or lifetime tax allowance.</li>
  <li>Taking your whole pension in one go could affect your entitlement to benefits.</li>
  <li>You may be able to keep paying in after you take money out but you could pay tax on contributions over £4,000 a year (known as the ‘money purchase annual allowance’).</li>

<p class="emphasise">
  You should think about this option carefully. Once you’ve taken the money out you can’t change the decision and you lose the tax-free status it had while in your pot.
