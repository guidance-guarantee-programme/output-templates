<h2 class="option option--untouched">Leave your pot untouched</h2>

<h3>Key facts</h3>

<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>While the money stays in your pot you don’t pay tax on it.</li>
  <li>It’s up to you when you take the money out – the earliest is usually aged 55, unless you have a serious illness.</li>
  <li>If someone contacts you unexpectedly about getting money out of your pot before you’re 55, it’s nearly always a pension scam.</li>
  <li>You can also still pay into your pot but there may be restrictions. If you’re an employee your employer might continue to make contributions too.</li>
  <li>Money left untouched can be passed on when you die.</li>
</ol>

<!-- option: annuity -->

<h2 class="option option--annuity">Get a guaranteed income (annuity)</h2>

<h3>Key facts</h3>

<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>This is the only option which gives you a guaranteed income.</li>

  <li>You can buy an annuity for a fixed term or for the rest of your life.</li>
  <li>You can take up to 25% of your pot tax free – if you do this you must buy an annuity with the remaining 75% within 6 months or use one of the other options.</li>
  <li>If you’re currently receiving a pension income it’s likely that you’ve already bought an annuity or are taking an income from a final salary or career average (defined benefit) pension.</li>
  <li>There are many different types of annuity and it’s important you get the right one for you.</li>

<h2 class="option option--adjustable">Get an adjustable income</h2>

<h3>Key facts</h3>

<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>Your pot is invested to give you a regular, taxable income. You decide how much to take out and when, and how long you want it to last.</li>
  <li>You can take up to 25% of your pot tax free – if you do this, you must move the remaining 75% into an adjustable income product within 6 months or use one of the other options.</li>
  <li>You’re likely to be involved in choosing and managing your investments.</li>
  <li>As with all investments, the value of your pot can go up or down.</li>
  <li>You can still pay into your pot but there may be restrictions – you need to be aware of ‘pension recycling’ tax laws.</li>
  <li>This option is also known as ‘flexi-access drawdown’.</li>
</ol>

<p class="emphasise">You can’t take cash in chunks later if you choose this option.</p>

<!-- option: chunks -->
<div class="page-break"></div>
<h2 class="option option--chunks">Take cash in chunks</h2>

<h3>Key facts</h3>

<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>Instead of taking your whole pot in one go, you take smaller chunks over time. 25% of each chunk you take out is tax free and the rest is taxable.</li>
  <li>The chunks of cash you take get taxed along with any other income you have, eg from work, savings or investments.</li>
  <li>You can spread the chunks out over multiple tax years to reduce your income which could mean you pay less tax.</li>
  <li>If you have more than one pot, you can take chunks of cash from one and continue to pay into others but you need to be aware of ‘pension recycling’ tax laws.</li>
  <li>Providers may describe this option as ‘Uncrystallised Funds Pension Lump Sum’ (UFPLS).</li>
</ol>

<p class="emphasise">If you invest your pot into flexi-access drawdown, you won’t be able to take any more tax-free cash and can’t use this option.</p>

<div class="page-break"></div>
<h2 class="option option--whole">Take your whole pot in one go</h2>

<h3>Key facts</h3>

<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>If you take your whole pension pot in one go 25% is tax free and the remaining 75% is taxable.</li>
  <li>The money from your pot will be added to any other income you have over the tax year.</li>
  <li>Adding a large cash sum to your income could mean that you get bumped into a higher tax rate.</li>
  <li>You can take up to 3 small pots of up to £10,000 without it counting towards your annual or lifetime tax allowance.</li>
  <li>Taking your whole pot in one go could affect your entitlement to benefits.</li>
  <li>Once you’ve taken the money out you can’t change the decision and you lose the tax-free status it had while in your pot.</li>
</ol>

<p class="emphasise">You should think about this option carefully unless your pot is £10,000 or less, or you have more than one pot and only want to cash in one of them.</p>
<p class="emphasise">You need to be aware of ‘pension recycling’ tax laws if you plan to cash in one pot and pay into another. </p>
