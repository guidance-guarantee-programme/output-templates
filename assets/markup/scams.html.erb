<h2>Watch out for pension scams</h2>

<p>A pension scam is where someone tries to con you out of money in your pension pot. A scam will often start with a ‘cold call’ – this can be a phone call, a text message, an email, a visit in person, or other ways. </p>

<p class="emphasise">Never let yourself be pressured into making a decision during a cold call.</p>

<h3>How to spot a scam</h3>
<p>It’s likely to be a scam if an individual or company:</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>Says they can help you access your pension money before 55.</li>
  <li>Encourages you to take out a large lump sum or your whole pot in one go and to let them invest it for you.</li>
  <li>Asks you to transfer your money quickly, even sending documents to you by courier – you should never rush a decision about your pension money.</li>
  <li>Uses words like ‘pension liberation’, ‘loan’, ‘loophole’ or ‘free pension review’.</li>
  <li>Offers you an investment described as ‘unique’, ‘overseas’, ‘environmentally friendly’, ‘ethical’ or in a ‘new’ industry.</li>
</ul>

<p>Always phone your provider if you receive an email saying that they’ve changed their bank details and want you to make payments into a new account – this is almost always a scam.</p>

<p class="emphasise">Once you’ve transferred your pension money into a scam, it’s too late. You could lose all your money and face a tax bill of up to 55% of the amount transferred. Your provider may also charge you fees.</p>
