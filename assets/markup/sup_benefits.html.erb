<h2>Benefits and pension income</h2>
<p>If you’re claiming benefits or planning to apply for means-tested benefits in the future, any income from your pension pot will be taken into account. This may affect your entitlement to some benefits or mean you get less money.</p>

<h3>When your pension affects your benefits</h3>
<p>The way money from your pension is assessed depends on whether you or your partner have reached the qualifying age for Pension Credit - use the State Pension calculator on GOV.UK to check when this is.</p>

<p>Money from your (or your partner’s) pot may affect your entitlement to benefits:</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>Before Pension Credit qualifying age: any income or cash sums you’ve taken from your pot.</li>
  <li>After Pension Credit qualifying age: any money sitting in your pot, plus any income or money taken in chunks or your whole pot in one go.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Taking an income from your pension</h3>
<p>Once you reach Pension Credit qualifying age you may or may not take an income from your pension.</p>

<h4>If you don’t take an income:</h4>

<ul class="list">
  <li>The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) or your local council will check how much you’d get if you got a guaranteed income (annuity).</li>
  <li>This amount will be taken into account when your income is assessed (known as your ‘notional income’).</li>
</ul>

<h4>If you do take an income:</h4>

<ul class="list">
  <li>If it’s lower than your notional income, the higher amount will be taken into account when your income is assessed.</li>
  <li>If it’s higher than your notional income, this amount will be used instead.</li>
</ul>

<p class="emhpasise">It’s your responsibility to tell DWP or your local council if you or your partner take any money from your pension pot.</p>

<p>If you deliberately spend or give away money (including tax-free cash) from your pot to get or increase benefits and help with care costs, DWP or your local council may assess your eligibility again and treat you as still having that money.</p>

<p>In addition to any income or cash taken from your pot, your other assets (eg savings and investments) may also count when you’re assessed for benefits.</p>

<h3>Getting help with benefits</h3>
<p>For more information about benefits entitlement you can speak to Citizens Advice (see ‘Further free and impartial guidance’).</p>
